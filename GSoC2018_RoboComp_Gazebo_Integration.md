## Introduction

Currently RoboComp uses **RoboComp Innermodel Simulator (RCIS)**, an inbuilt simulator, to check its applications and algorithms. 
It provides a lot of basic tools and features to easily test an application developed by a developer. But besides its usefulness, 
more tools and features need to be developed to make it better. So, **Gazebo** was chosen to serve as an secondary options to 
the developers to test their algorithms and fulfill their needs to the fullest.

So, the project aims to provide RoboComp with a simulator that has better options and features for the developers.
So, here we are with a working model of the integration that uses ICE framework as a communication layer combined with the 
Gazebo’s transport layer to have a seamless communication between gazebo simulator and any robocomp simulator. For the ones who
don’t what is Ice, Internet Communications Engine (Ice) is an object-oriented RPC framework that helps you build distributed 
server-client base applications with minimal effort.
